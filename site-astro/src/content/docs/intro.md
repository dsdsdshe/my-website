description: What is MindQuantum and how this site is organized.
---

MindQuantum is an open‑source quantum computing framework built with MindSpore.

This documentation is rendered with Astro + Starlight for a consistent, modern UX across the homepage and docs.

Goals of this rework:

- Consistent visual style across home and docs (single design system).
- Modern, MD/MDX‑based authoring with component slots where needed.
- Simple ingestion pipeline to sync tutorials from the MindSpore/docs repo.
- Scalable features: i18n, versioning, search, and analytics.
