    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "`mqchem` is an integrated toolbox designed specifically for solving quantum chemistry problems. Its core advantage lies in its simulation method based on **Configuration Interaction (CI)**. Unlike general-purpose simulators that operate in the full $2^{N}$-dimensional Hilbert space, `mqchem`'s simulator evolves within a subspace defined by a fixed number of electrons (`n_electrons`). This approach significantly reduces runtime, enabling us to simulate chemical systems of 20 qubits or more in a very short amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `mqchem` module primarily consists of three core components that work in synergy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`CIHamiltonian`**: For efficiently representing the Hamiltonian of a chemical problem.\n",
    "- **`UCCExcitationGate`**: The fundamental building block for variational ansatze like UCCSD.\n",
    "- **`MQChemSimulator`**: A high-performance simulator that performs quantum circuit evolution and measurements within the CI space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn to follow a natural workflow using the components of the `mqchem` module to solve a chemistry problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the core components of `mqchem` and their respective responsibilities.\n",
    "2. Learn how to combine these components to apply a quantum circuit and calculate expectation values.\n",
    "3. Utilize the high-level function `prepare_uccsd_vqe` to quickly set up a complete VQE workflow.\n",
    "4. Work through a hands-on example to calculate the ground state energy of a linear H₆ molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites**:\n",
    "Before you begin, please ensure you have MindQuantum installed, along with `openfermion` and `openfermionpyscf` for chemistry calculations.\n",

    "\n",

    "As you can see, the VQE result is very close to the exact FCI energy, and the entire optimization process completed in under 0.02 seconds! This demonstrates the correctness and high performance of the `mqchem` components working together.\n",

    "## 5. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we systematically introduced the `mqchem` module. We started with its three core components—`CIHamiltonian`, `UCCExcitationGate`, and `MQChemSimulator`—to understand their respective roles in the quantum chemistry simulation workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "We not only learned how to use these components individually but, more importantly, saw how they seamlessly integrate to solve practical problems. Finally, through a VQE example of calculating the ground state energy of an H₆ molecule, we demonstrated how to use convenient tools like `prepare_uccsd_vqe` to efficiently build and run a complete quantum chemistry simulation pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `mqchem` module provides powerful support for high-performance, high-precision quantum chemistry research on the MindQuantum platform. We hope this tutorial helps you get started quickly and encourages you to explore more interesting chemistry problems"
